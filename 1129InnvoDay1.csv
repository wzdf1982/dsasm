-Ericsson Cloud System is a comprehensive solution for the distribution and orchestration of cloud capabilities horizontally across the network, enabling new vertical exposure opportunities. The solution includes the Ericsson Cloud Execution Environment and the Ericsson Cloud Manager. The solution leverages not only on the Ericsson Blade System (EBS), it also stretches out in the NW to the Ericsson Smart Services Router (SSR) and all the way out to the RAN access. 
The Ericsson Cloud Manager is the core of the distributed Ericsson Telco Cloud architecture, by providing a homogeneous and holistic view of the whole physical and virtual infrastructure required to provide an end to end infrastructure as a service experience. 
Benefits to Customer
-In response to this evolving need, Ericsson introduces the Ericsson Cloud System. This revolutionary cloud solution enables customers to grasp market opportunities by enabling end-to-end elasticity using network assets. It enables distributed cloud capabilities such as computing and storage capabilities in the network, resulting in a better experience when using cloud applications, and more efficient utilization of network resources.
